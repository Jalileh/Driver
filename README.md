ATTENTION
This Project is on display only to show people where I was 3 years ago and I highly advise not trying to get this to work or use any of the code without knowing what you're doing.
Neither do I recommend using the code for if I recall correctly there is a serious bug present in the knownProcess implementation which may trick your usermode comm that the process is still running and you may r/w to another process that took the PID

About
This Driver is an unsigned driver technically malware just like anti cheats, but the purpose of it was to protect my cheat customers from said anticheats.
Tons of crashes happened until I got the driver to this state and would recommend people to write usermode wrapped kernel code rather than write it on the kernel unless you can run a vm.


Anyway regardless of how terrible I perceive the implementation of my crazy ideas back then i am so glad I did this, 
although learning computer science, assembly and literally bit by bit manipulation by doing projects like these will not impress HR enough to even give you a baby-junior unpaid intership in ANY TECH FIELD.
